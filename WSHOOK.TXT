Implementation of action in case of open/close of the websocket channel
=======================================================================

call remote endpoint in case of open or close connection on the websocket.

the call is made on a second thread to avoid blocking/change current websocket behaviour.
in case of io error (like network) the thread will sleep {wsHook.retryTimeout} milliseconds.
There is no retry count

Http status error >= 400 & != 503 are considered as fatal and will be only log without reprocessing.


new GET endpoint on CCS to retrive USER/CONTROLLER connected to the CCS

list all connected
{CCS_BASE_URI}/ccs/rest/controllers

check status by controller oid
{CCS_BASE_URI}/ccs/rest/controllers/{controlerOid}

check status by username
{CCS_BASE_URI}/ccs/rest/controllers/?username={username}


Response expected :

{
  "errorMessage": null,
  "result": [
    {
      "ccsIp": "172.17.0.3",
      "controllerId": 1,
      "username": "user"
    }
  ]
}

new config parameters :

#BASE URI of endpoint called by CCS
wsHook.baseUri=http://172.17.0.1:3000

#suffix of the URI in case of opened websocket
wsHook.openPath=/open

#suffix of the URI in case of closed websocket
wsHook.closePath=/close

#timeout between 2 retry calling the endpoint
wsHook.retryTimeout=30000

#CCS IP pass as data to the endpoint
ccs.ip=172.17.0.3

// TEST STATUS:

Unit test of ConnectionHookConsumer

openOk : happy flow
open404 : fatal Error no retry
open300 : error should retry

closeOk : happy flow
close404 : fatal Error no retry
close300 : error should retry

Missing test : test of endpoints after WS open and close
